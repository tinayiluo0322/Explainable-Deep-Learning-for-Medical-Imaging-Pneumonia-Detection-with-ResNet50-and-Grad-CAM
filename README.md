# Explainable-Deep-Learning-for-Medical-Imaging-Pneumonia-Detection-with-ResNet50-and-Grad-CAM
This project uses a pre-trained ResNet50 model with Grad-CAM to classify chest X-rays as healthy or pneumonia-affected, enhancing model interpretability. Statistical analysis of feature importance scores between classes evaluates the model's focus on relevant medical features, promoting transparency in AI-driven healthcare.
